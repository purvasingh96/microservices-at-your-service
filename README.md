# Microservices at your service! üëæ

##  Implementing Service Registry using Eureka Server üçÄ
1. Create a `maven-scala-seed` project in your VS Code.
2. Leverage the `pom.xml` file which has the latest related dependencies. Then, build the project.
3. `application.yml` has related configurations such as port etc, which is crucial so that our server doesn't try to register with itself.
4. Be extra careful while installing the correction version of dependencies.
